# Semantic-arena
This repository provides a platform to develop semantic drl based navigation approaches. It uses to arena-rosnav repository and combines it with pedsim for human behavior modeling. Furthermore it extends the pedisim social force model with industrial object classes like forklift, vehicle or collaborative robots. 
The repository also provides 3 semantic drl-based agents which are able to navigate savely around different human types.
